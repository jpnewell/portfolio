This will contain samples of my code throughout my software development adventure. - jpn072020

Vending Machine is an early CLI project I worked on with one other student at Tech Elevator.
We wrote the software to mimic the functionality of a typical vending machine.  We used file
input/output to load inventory items and log all user transactions with the machine.  There is 
also an option to create a sales history report.  I had a lot of fun with this project as it 
was our first project using OOP concepts.  All ASCII art credits go to my partner Josiah Kuha.

The Roman numeral converter was merely a commitment to finish out the logic started in class.
During a lecture on unit testing and TDD, we began to write the tests for converting arabic 
numbers to Roman, but we never came close to completing the logic and I was determined to get
it worked out.  I must say the unit tests were a great help on this one.

Naughts & Crosses is a simple tic-tac-toe program using vanilla javascript for the logic and 
HTML/CSS for the playing board.  I was inspired to create it after a homework exercise where 
we had to create a functioning calculator.  The game play is far less complex than the business logic!  
I spent a great deal of time working that out on my notepad.  I did write the logic to be 
scalable to a larger board size.

Our final capstone project was Restaurant Finder and I was part of team of four.  We followed 
an Agile approach to this project where our instructor served as project manager and we each
had to discuss our progress and challenges during daily stand-ups.  This project brought together
everything we had learned at Tech Elevator; a fully functional website utilizing a full stack
of development languages and tools.  The website was created using C#, SQL and Vue.js to 
integrate the front and backend API's.  Using a json web token, only authorized users may
access the sites functional areas.  Based on their preferred restaurant type(s) and zip code, 
the list of restaurants is tailored and they swipe right to 'like' and swipe left to 'reject'
the suggested restaurant.  Their profile/preferences and liked restaurants are updated to the 
database in real-time.  The restaurant details include location, pic, Covid-19 message and
even a Google Map.  This project was a blast!  Divvying up the workload during our daily and sprint
stand-ups gave us a taste of Agile development in a real world setting.
